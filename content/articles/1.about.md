# About Me: Kilroy

Hello, I am Kilroy.

## Introduction 
Here's a glimpse into who I am:

- **Hacker**: I love breaking software, I am more then a black hat, even though some days I am, some days I am a white hat, and others I am a grey hat, so stick along for the ride. 

- **Eagle Scout**: I got my Eagle Scout in 2022. 

- **Gamer**: I love to play games like Call of Duty Mobile (CODM), I will upload recordings and live streams to Youtube when I remember I have a channel. 

- **Anarchist**: I strive to challenge oppressive hierarchy's, this blog will be showing some of my views about common every day things that we take for granted, and what is wrong with them. 

- **Mess**: Yes, I am a huge mess, and I struggle with my mental health, this blog will be going into it a bit more. 

## Hobbies and Interests

Beyond the crazy stuff mentioned above, I have some hobbies and interests:

- **Exploring Technology**: I love Technology, and this might be the beef of my posts, I love how it works, and I love breaking it, I also love trying to figure out stuff that I should not to know. 

- **Outdoor Adventures**: Being an Eagle Scout, I LOVE the outdoors, I love camping, I love hiking.

- **Running**: Running is the only time that I can escape from my mess above.

## Research and Projects

I work on and manage a few projects:

I have created my own search engine [Sturtz Search](https://www.sturtz.io) I have used this to crawl the web and to learn about everything from web servers and database maintenance to critical thinking and problem solving. 
My Search engine at this time is Closed Source, I do plan on releasing the source code as soon as I finish removing the libraries that do not work with each other. 
I am very passionate about open source, I will try and use small, open source, projects for what I use and run. 

Another thing  that I run and actively maintain is Sturtz Suite, it is based on and built using [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com), This is my version of Google's Drive, Docs, Forms, Sheets it is all based out of servers I physically control. 
[Sturtz Cloud](https://cloud.sturtz.io) uses end to end, and full disk encryption.
