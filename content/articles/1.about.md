# About Me: Kilroy

Hello, I am Kilroy.

## Introduction 
Here's a glimpse into who I am:

- **Hacker**: I love breaking software, I am more then a black hat, even though some days I am, some days I am a white hat, and others I am a grey hat, so stick along for the ride. 

- **Eagle Scout**: I got my Eagle Scout in 2022. 

- **Gamer**: I love to play games like Call of Duty Mobile (CODM), I will upload recordings and live streams to Youtube when I remember I have a channel. 

- **Anarchist**: I strive to challenge oppressive hierarchy's, this blog will be showing some of my views about common every day things that we take for granted, and what is wrong with them. 

- **Mess**: Yes, I am a huge mess, and I struggle with my mental health, this blog will be going into it a bit more. 

## Hobbies and Interests

Beyond the crazy stuff mentioned above, I have some hobbies and interests:

- **Exploring Technology**: I love Technology, and this might be the beef of my posts, I love how it works, and I love breaking it, I also love trying to figure out stuff that I should not to know. 

- **Outdoor Adventures**: Being an Eagle Scout, I LOVE the outdoors, I love camping, I love hiking.

- **Running**: Running is the only time that I can escape from my mess above.

## Research and Projects

I actively explore the digital landscape through various projects:

Creating a Search Engine: One of my proudest achievements is building my own search engine. It's been an incredible journey, learning all about web indexing, info retrieval, and search algorithms. My tech skills have really leveled up, and now I understand how info gets organized and found on the web.

Micro Google Suite: At home, I set up a mini Google Suite with cloud storage, docs, forms, sheets, slides, and my search engine. It's been a hands-on experience that's really honed my cybersecurity and server management and collaboration skills. Tech in everyday life is just mind-blowing, and my personalized suite is a game-changer for sure.
