# Anarchy


## Introduction

Anarchy to me means getting rid of oppressive hierarchies, and replacing it with voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and self-governance. 

For me, Anarchy is **NOT** about violence or chaos, but rather about peace and freedom. It's centered on personal choice and one's inherent human rights. This philosophy is grounded in the ability to lead your life in alignment with your desires, without being subjected to a system that contradicts your views. It underscores the importance of making independent decisions, devoid of external interference. Ultimately, Anarchy is about living life on your own terms and avoiding compulsion into a disagreeable system. It's about having the freedom to shape your own journey and not having others dictate your choices. 
## Anarchy: Beyond Chaos and Violence

As I mentioned earlier, my views on Anarchy doesn't align with deriving pleasure from violence or chaos. I hold the perspective that these elements can function as tools. My personal views leans towards peace and non-violence. However, I also acknowledge the historical and contextual instances where violence and chaos have been wielded as instruments to achieve particular goals or to spark needed changes.

It's essential to make clear between my personal preferences and the understanding that violence and chaos, when used appropriately and ethically, can serve as means of change. When applied correctly, I indeed understand and advocate for the use of Violence and chaos but only under specific circumstances. I understand the significance of their impacts on societies, politics, and revolutions throughout history.


## The Spectrum of Anarchist Approaches

I personally use two analogies to describe fellow anarchist: "Molotov-throwing anarchists" and "pen-throwing anarchists."

### Molotov-Throwing Anarchists

The term "Molotov-throwing anarchists" is used to represent individuals who adopt more confrontational and revolutionary tactics. They may engage in direct action, protests, or acts of civil disobedience to challenge oppressive power structures and advocate for radical change. However, it is crucial to note that not all anarchists condone or participate in violent or destructive actions. "Molotov-throwing" signifies a symbol of radical activism and resistance to authority.

### Pen-Throwing Anarchists

Conversely, the term "pen-throwing anarchists" metaphorically represents those who focus on intellectual and philosophical endeavors rather than direct confrontation. They engage in writing, publishing, or promoting their ideas through peaceful means, aiming to challenge dominant narratives and advocate for social change. These "pen-throwing anarchists" believe in the power of ideas to influence public opinion and encourage dialogue among people.


### Where I fall on the Molotov - Pen Spectrum

Personally, I lean more Pen Throwing, but I also do understand, and I do have a foot in the Molotov throwing side. I do not think I can say this enough, I understand the use of violence and chaos, and I will advocate for Violence and chaos, and use them properly when the time comes.
